# hello-world

Hi. I'm James.


I am a 29 year old Korean-American living in South Korea teaching English and I am just starting to learn how to code.

I have to say.. It is very interesting! I am especially interested in Front-End developing at the moment. Designing and putting together a website would be totally AWESOME.

I know I have a long way to go but I know that within a year I see myself as a developer!

Being a developer would change my life. I would be able to work and FINALLY move back to the states. 

I have been trying to find ways to get back to the states (Getting back there wouldn't be a problem...the problem is that I don't have any skills other than teaching English.)


Thank you for reading.
